# django_rent_or_buy
Rent or Buy website written by Django

NumPy_Pandas_rent_or_buy
I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot a statistical data visualization to see how data was distributed and applied the results to build a user-approach housing search website with Django. See the user-approach housing search website at django_rent_or_buy.
