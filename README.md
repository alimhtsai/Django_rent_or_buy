## django_rent_or_buy

I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot a statistical data visualization to see how data was distributed and applied the results to build a user-approach housing search website with Django. See the Matplotlib and Seaborn project at [NumPy_Pandas_rent_or_buy](https://github.com/alimhtsai/NumPy_Pandas_rent_or_buy).
